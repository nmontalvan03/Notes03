# Notes 03: AWS Global Infrastructure

# Cloud Computing 

They are provision of computer services which we have servers, storage, database,
networks, software among other services that benefit through the Internet giving it more flexibility, innovation
e economy, and applications that you want to use for cloud computing whether for business or in
individual.

the global Infrastructure is a designed to give you better flexibility to choose where and how you want
running the workload also provides cloud computing security with high quality performance
of the global network.

# AWS Regions

These regions are isolated from each other, since they have a specific location to run their resources.
without any problem because each region is divided into several zones. If you store data in a region
specify this will only stay in that region since it is your responsibility if you want to replicate data near another
region if it is for your business or any other projects that you want to replicate.

Although the geographical areas are separated, the client is given the option to choose the closest region.
so you can host your infrastructure in the cloud, detailing that the closer your region is, the better for
acquire faster service in the data center.

#  AWS Region are: 

-  Geographical area.
-  Data replication acroos regions is controlled by you.
-  Comunication between Regions uses AWS backbone network Infraestructure.
-  Each Reion provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network.
-  A Region typycally consist of two or more availibility zones.

# Best practices for choosing AWS Regions

- Proximity: Choose a region closest to your location and your customers’ location to optimizenetwork latency.
- Services: Try and think about what are your most needed services. Usually, the newest services start on a few main regions then pop up in other regions later.
- Cost: Certain regions will cost more than others, so use built-in AWS calculators to do rough cost estimates to inform your choices.
- Service Level Agreement (SLA): Just as with cost, your SLA details will vary by region, so be sure to be aware of what your needs are and if they’re being met.
- Compliance: You may need to meet regulatory compliance needs such as GDPR by hosting your deployment in a specific — or multiple regions.

 
 One of the resources that AWS global infrastructure provides that caught my attention is how it provides you with the information.
 so that you can acquire a better service faster without any problem when hosting your infrastructure in the cloud
 detailing that you must choose in which region you want your services and that has a better internet connection where
 You can work without any problem when using the applications. We also have data centers, they are data centers.
 It is the physical installation where you can store applications and data, which data center requires an infrastructure
 that can support hardware and software, which includes design such as router, firewalls, storage systems among other components
 of data center.

 In this module I learned how to use AWS applications, which regions have better connectivity, network quality,
 the benefits of storing your data in the cloud without any problem, it also provides you with the information
 In which regions they are located, giving you better flexibility and security, which details what the data center contains.
 to help you have better performance, speed and security in the applications you want to use.

 Will it depend on what area it is located in to obtain quality network connectivity?
